Description:
This program provides an easy-to-use environment where a user can draw a symbol
that represents an ASCII character, enter what character they drew, and save
the data representing their drawing and the number it is associated with it.

These files will be saved in a folder in this program's directory called:
char_data/[character drawn]_saved

'character drawn' refers to the ASCII character the user associated this
character to when creating the file.

The data will be saved in this folder's subdirectory called:
data/ 

Data files will be named:
[num]_[character drawn]_data.dat

'num' refers to the next number after the maximum numbered file already in that
folder. Think of it as the ID number of this drawn character.

The data file will contain the following:
- On the first line, the ASCII character this number represents
- On the following lines, the list of pixel values drawn on the screen, 
  represented as 0s (not drawn) and 1s (drawn), starting from the upper left
  corner and going from left to right and top to bottom.
